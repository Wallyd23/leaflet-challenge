# Leaflet Challenge - Earthquake Visualization

## Overview

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystems, and the environment. This project aims to create an interactive map to visualize earthquake data collected by the USGS. The visualization includes the magnitude and depth of earthquakes, with additional layers to show tectonic plates.

## Features

- **Earthquake Visualization**: Display all recorded earthquakes from the past week with markers sized by magnitude and colored by depth.
- **Tectonic Plates**: Overlay showing the tectonic plates boundaries.
- **Multiple Base Maps**: Choose between different base maps including Street, Satellite, Grayscale, and Outdoors.
- **Layer Controls**: Toggle between earthquake data and tectonic plates.
